MISP is an open source software solution for collecting, storing, distributing and sharing cyber security indicators and threats about cyber security incidents analysis and malware analysis. MISP is designed by and for incident analysts, security and ICT professionals or malware reversers to support their day-to-day operations to share structured information efficiently.

The objective of MISP is to foster the sharing of structured information within the security community and abroad. MISP provides functionalities to support the exchange of information but also the consumption of said information by Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS), LIDS but also log analysis tools, SIEMs ...

<!-- Object Description -->
## MISP GameCheat Object
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[![project-logo]](https://github.com/RudigerMorinDocter/MISP-GameCheats)

As stated in the introduction, the goal of this object is to implement a new MISP object describing a video game cheat application (called "Game Cheat" in our repository).

The idea that lead us to create such an object is that game cheats and/or cheatware is often linked to malware, especially when it is distributed for free. Since the MISP project does not seem to have this kind of object implemented yet, it could be used as a base for future improvement and use by the community.

As the subject of game cheats is extremely wide, we encourage anyone who has the courage to fork our repository and continue our work ! ‚ò†Ô∏è
